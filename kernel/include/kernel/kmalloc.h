//The headers need to be even-byte aligned
//Status has the following layout:
//Bit 0:  Whether or not the memory section this header refers to is free
//Bits 1-31:  The address of the previous memory section's header
//The next memory section can be found by (&memheader + size)+sizeof(memheader_t)
//and then rounding it up to the nearest even number.
//Note that if size is 0, then the upper 31 bits of status are instead treated as a
//pointer to the next memory section.  This next memory section's 31 status bits
//will, in turn, point to the memory header of the section that pointed to the 0
//size header.  That is to say:  While traversing the memory list backwards, one
//will never encounter any headers with size 0.

//Also note that size is always an even number.  kalloc will round up the requested
//memory such that this invariant always holds true.
